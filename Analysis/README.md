The Analysis section contains `EDA` and `Statistical Analysis`.<br><br>

[Part 1, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):](https://github.com/greatsharma/MPG/blob/master/Analysis/eda-on-mpg-data.ipynb)<br>
This part consists of summary statistics of data but the major focus will be on EDA where I extract meaning/information
from data using plots and report important insights about data. This part is more about `data analysis` and `business 
intelligence(BI)`. You can follow this entire notebook on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gauravsharma99/eda-on-mpg-data/) as well.


[Part 2, Statistical Analysis:](https://github.com/greatsharma/MPG/blob/master/Analysis/statistical-analysis-on-mpg-data.ipynb)<br>
In this part I will do many statistical hypothesis testing, apply estimation statistics and interpret the results.
I will also validate this with the findings from part one. I will apply both parametric and non-parametric tests.
This part is all about `data science` requires statistical background. You can follow this entire notebook on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gauravsharma99/statistical-analysis-on-mpg-data) as well.
