# MPG

[Part 1, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):](https://github.com/greatsharma/MPG/blob/master/Analysis/eda-on-mpg-data.ipynb)<br>
This part consists of summary statistics of data but the major focus will be on EDA where I extract meaning/information
from data using plots and report important insights about data. This part is more about `data analysis` and `business 
intelligence(BI)`. You can follow this entire notebook on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gauravsharma99/eda-on-mpg-data/) as well.


[Part 2, Statistical Analysis:](https://github.com/greatsharma/MPG/blob/master/Analysis/statistical-analysis-on-mpg-data.ipynb)<br>
In this part I will do many statistical hypothesis testing, apply estimation statistics and interpret the results.
I will also validate this with the findings from part one. I will apply both parametric and non-parametric tests.
This part is all about `data science` requires statistical background. You can follow this entire notebook on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gauravsharma99/statistical-analysis-on-mpg-data) as well.

[Part 3, Predictive Modelling:](https://github.com/greatsharma/MPG/tree/master/Modelling)<br>
In this part I will predict `mpg` using predictors. This part is all about `machine learning`. I used many data pipelines and models for training and then predict using the best found pipeline and model.

### Data Description

The data we are using is the [auto mpg](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg) dataset taken from UCI repository.

Information regarding data<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Title:** Auto-Mpg Data<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Number of Instances:** 398<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Number of Attributes:** 9 including the class attribute<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Attribute Information:**
```
    1. mpg:           continuous
    2. cylinders:     multi-valued discrete
    3. displacement:  continuous
    4. horsepower:    continuous
    5. weight:        continuous
    6. acceleration:  continuous
    7. model year:    multi-valued discrete
    8. origin:        multi-valued discrete
    9. car name:      string (unique for each instance)
    
    All the attributes are self-explanatory.
```
This data is not complex and is good for analysis as it has a nice blend of both categorical and numerical attributes.
